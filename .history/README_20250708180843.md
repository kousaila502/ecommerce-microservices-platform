# My E-Commerce Microservices Platform

## About This Project
This project began as a learning exercise using the e-commerce microservices sample by [venkataravuri](https://github.com/venkataravuri/e-commerce-microservices-sample). However, it has been extensively modified and enhanced with:

- ✅ **Complete UI Rewrite**: Modern React with Material-UI, TypeScript
- ✅ **Authentication System**: JWT-based auth with role management  
- ✅ **Enhanced User Management**: Admin controls, user roles, profile management
- ✅ **Improved Search**: Elasticsearch integration with real-time search
- ✅ **Modern Architecture**: Updated APIs, better error handling, CORS support
- ✅ **Production Ready**: Proper validation, security, and deployment configs
